a)
Statics eqs:
x: f_a - N_c >= 0
y: N_a + f_c - mg >= 0
t: r * (N_c + f_c - mg/2) >=0

Min normal force N_c requires max friction force f_c = N_c * u_c:
t ->  N_c + N_c * u_c >= mg/2
-> N_c >= mg/(2 * (1 + u_c))

b) 
x -> f_a >= N_c
If f_c = N_c * u_c and the box still slips, there won't be a (static) way to lift the box (a dynamic impact would do it). f_a would be at it's max for the corresponding N_a * u_a
y -> N_a + f_c - mg >= 0, substituting f_c = N_c * u_c
-> N_a + N_c * u_c >= mg

[not super happy with this answer from this point on]
-> N_a >= mg - N_c * u_c, substituting into f_a = N_a * u_a >= N_c
-> (mg - N_c * u_c) * u_a >= N_c
-> mg*u_a/(1 + u_c * u_a) >= N_c

c) mg*u_a/(1 + u_c * u_a) >= mg/(2 * (1 + u_c))
-> u_a/(1 + u_c * u_a) >= 1/(2 * (1 + u_c))
-> 2 * u_a * (1 + u_c) >= 1 + u_c * u_a
-> 2 * u_a + 2 * u_a * u_c >= 1 + u_c * u_a
-> u_a * (2 + u_c) >= 1

u_a = .25 -> u_c = 2 which would be some sort of gluey substatance
u_a = 1 -> u_c = -1 which would be some sort of friction defying repulsive substance
