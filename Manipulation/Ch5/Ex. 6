a) The timescale is large enough that by physics equations predict the block will have fallen past the ramp by the next time step.
d)  The FBD's boild down to mu1_static >= tan(theta) and mu2_dymanic = tan(theta). If we allow static and dynamic mu to be equal, technically the two coeffiecients can be the same.
If dynamic can be less than static, then m2 static could be larger than mu static.
