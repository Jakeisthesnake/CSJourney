a) theta = arctan(mu)
b) yes: all the spheres are stacked vertically creating an unstable equilibrium. All forces are vertical and pass through the center of each sphere, so no friction is required.
c) no: in order to be in static equilibrium in translation, the force due to friction is nin-zero which creates a torque that is un opposed, leading to rotation.
d) guess yes, but no proof other than the simulation didn't move
e) guess yes, but no proof other than the simulation didn't move
f) The initial guess matters because it is non convex evidenced by the trig functions that relate the positions and the reaction forces.
g) An FBD can solve for wheter q is in the joint limits and wheter there is penetration. (I think...)
