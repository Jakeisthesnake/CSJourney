If the question is asking how to allow 90 degree rotations as correct, even if they violate the known correspondances:
In 2D:
1) Find the centriod
2) Discard the points in 3 of the 4 quadrants wrt to the centroid
3) Solving with ICP should allow the object to snap into the closest symmetry.

Same in 3d but using only one octet instead of one quadrant.

Oh, hmmm I wonder if there is a way to put a constrain on R such that it is +/- 45 degrees in 2D (which would correspond to limiting the diagnol of R to (1/sqrt(2), 1) and for 3d... somehow contraining the variables to limit the rotation.
Hmmm actually this won't get us there since the correspondances get in the way. Yeah, not how to deal with them without just deleting them and establishing new correspondances...

Oh, I guess, you could just solve as you did originally, but then just measure how much the scene was rotated and then substract 90 degrees until it is fixed in the quadrant +/- 45 degrees.
This would generalize to 3D. Hmmm not sure if this answers the question.
