a) Cost = (p_x + a - 1)^2 + (p_y + b)^2 + (p_x - a)^2 + (p_y - b)^2, taking first and second partials wrt to p_x, p_y, a, and b gave a minimal at 0, 0, 0, and 1 resprectively.
This happens when the corresponding points start closer to eachother than to the point they don't correspond to (i.e. if you draw a line the bisects the model rectangle,
the scene point that corresponds to the right side has to start in the right half and visaversa for the left scene point.

b) seemded trivial to flip the numbers and repeat the math.

c) If both scene points correspond to the same model point, W is the zero matrix. This gives R as the identity matrix which means that the rotation doesn't need to change regarless of the orientation.
This leads to the points just alinging with the scene points centered on whichever model point they both correspond to.
