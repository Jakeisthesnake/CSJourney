1b) No, since there would be no way to distinguish between the two pointclouds when making the masks without knowing more about the objects (i.e. are they rectangles?)
1c) If they are far apart than the clustering sould be able to seperate the two objects. However, we might be required to tell the algorythm that there are exactly
two objects in the object in the forground splits the view of the object in the backgground, making it look like there are two clusters.
1d) If the objects are too close, then the clustering alogythm might not be able to distinguish beteen the two objects.
If one ojects looked like a dumbell with two bulbous ends, and the other objects was close to one of the ends, then the dumbell might get split into two.
