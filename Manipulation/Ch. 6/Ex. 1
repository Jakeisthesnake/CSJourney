a) Z, roll (about z), and yaw (about x) can be given some leaniancy since the gripper can still be centered on the handel while letting those parameters flex.
For even more relaxation, the x and y position of the gripper can be relaxed as long as the y axis instesects the handel's z-axis.
b) min |q - q_nom|^2
   |p_WG_x - p_WH_x| = 0
   |p_WG_y - p_WH_y| = 0
   |R_WG_pitch - p_WH_pitch| = 0 degrees
   
   |p_WG_z - p_WH_z| < handle_length/2
   |R_WG_roll - p_WH_roll| < 15 degrees
   |R_WG_yaw - p_WH_yaw| < 15 degrees

   For more rigor, I think I would have to convert the Rotation costraints to expressions in terms of theta...
