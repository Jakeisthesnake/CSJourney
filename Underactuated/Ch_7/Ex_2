a) J = Int(0 to inf)[(x^2q_11 + y^2q_22 + theta^2q_33 + 2xyq_12 + 2xthetaq_13 + 2ythetaq_23) dt]
   Since we only want to penalize the magnitude of y, we set everything to zero except q_22 so that
   J = q_22 * Int(0 to inf)[y^2dt].
b) Nope, changing q_22 doesn't change the shape of J, since it will be picking u to minimize y regardless.
c) To penalize sharper turns, increase R to drive u^2 down which drives theta_dot down which is propotional to
   how sharp a tern is.
d) No, we would want a uy term to minimize the product of the streering rate and the distance from the centerline.
e) If we make all terms positive, we would drive the dynamics of the car to drive the car towards the origin with
   the car facing in the x direction with steering at rest. So basically a parking objective.
