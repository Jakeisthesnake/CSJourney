a) V(x*) = 0 since the x(t0) = x* stays as x*. V(z) is positive definite since
the inside of the integral is positive definite (the 2 norm is positive definite)
and the integral of a positive definite function is positive definite.
Thus V(z) - V(x*) is positive definite.

b) As z goes to infinity, ||z - x*|| goes to infinity. Thus the integral of |z - x*| goes to infinity (sort of,
this is hand wavy since z is a function of t, and theoretically, z could start arbitrarily far away,
but if z_dot is big enough, the integral could stay small).
