    Is our linear approximation valid for all the points we tested? No, some are too far from the point of linearization.
    Do we expect a linear controller to do a decent job when θ=π/2? Yes.
    When θ\thetaθ is different from zero, does the linearization error depend on u\mathbf{u}u? I originallly thought no, but seeing the results, it makes sense that it magnifies the error.
    Why is the error from the second case bigger than the one from the third, even if the second θ\thetaθ is closer to π\piπ than the third? Because u magnifies the error.
    What about the position xxx of the cart? Should it affect the linearization error? If no, why not? Because x is not an argument for f(x_hat, u)
